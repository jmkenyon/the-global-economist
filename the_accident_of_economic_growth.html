            <p>The conditions that drive economic growth is a highly debated topic among economists, international organisations, and governments. Some countries have been the recipients of high economic growth in recent decades, namely the East Asian ‘miracle’ economies. This spectacular growth has led to many countries trying to emulate their growth, with varying rates of success. Some economists, however, believe luck plays an important role in economic growth. Conditions that are uncontrollable such as climate, location, and natural resources play an important role in growth, leading to some countries being ‘luckier’ than others. On the other hand, it has been argued that good luck is a function of good policy, and countries need good policies to succeed. If luck does play a role in economic growth, counties should do more to help those who have been the recipient of bad luck.</p>

            <p>Economic growth is partly subject to the initial conditions of the country. Developing countries’ economies are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/africas-path-to-growth-sector-by-sector" target="_blank"> highly dependent</a> on agriculture. This, however, leads to volatility as agriculture is at the mercy of environmental conditions. Developing countries are more vulnerable than developed countries to environmental volatility, therefore reducing their likeliness of achieving the sustainable growth rate needed to develop their economy. Besides that, high levels of economic activity are typically located near coastlines because of cheaper and easier access to international trade. The burgeoning Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou are all found on the coast and  constitutes three out of the top four highest GDP cities in the country. Countries with high temperatures, volatile rainfall and are landlocked are more likely to be poor. On the other hand, countries such as the UK, benefiting from high rainfall, mild temperature, and easy access to oceanic trade, are more likely to develop faster. Indeed, the UK was the wealthiness country in the world in the 18th and 19th century. </p>
