            <p>The conditions that drive economic growth is a highly debated topic among economists, international organisations, and governments. Some countries have been the recipients of high economic growth in recent decades, namely the East Asian ‘miracle’ economies. This spectacular growth has led to many countries trying to emulate their growth, with varying rates of success. Some economists, however, believe luck plays an important role in economic growth. Conditions that are uncontrollable such as climate, location, and natural resources play an important role in growth, leading to some countries being ‘luckier’ than others. On the other hand, it has been argued that good luck is a function of good policy, and countries need good policies to succeed. If luck does play a role in economic growth, counties should do more to help those who have been the recipient of bad luck.</p>
            
            <p class="bold blog_heading">Is economic growth lucky?</p>
            
            <p>Economic growth is partly subject to the initial conditions of the country. Developing countries’ economies are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/africas-path-to-growth-sector-by-sector" target="_blank"> highly dependent</a> on agriculture. This, however, leads to volatility as agriculture is at the mercy of environmental conditions. Developing countries are more vulnerable than developed countries to environmental volatility, therefore reducing their likeliness of achieving the sustainable growth rate needed to develop their economy. Besides that, high levels of economic activity are typically located near coastlines because of cheaper and easier access to international trade. The burgeoning Chinese cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou are all found on the coast and  constitutes three out of the top four highest GDP cities in the country. Countries with high temperatures, volatile rainfall and are landlocked are more likely to be poor. On the other hand, countries such as the UK, benefiting from high rainfall, mild temperature, and easy access to oceanic trade, are more likely to develop faster. Indeed, the UK was the wealthiness country in the world in the 18th and 19th century. </p>

            <p class="bold blog_heading">Good policies are crucial for economic growth</p>
            
            <p>Despite the argument that the East Asian ‘miracle’ economies were the recipient of good fortune, these countries enacted policies that led to the conditions for high growth rates. Export-led industrialisation along with a degree of economic openness gave rise to fast-growing economies. In his book Bad Samaritans, Ha-Joon Chang argues that these countries used controlled FDI policies to give domestic industries the best opportunities to succeed. Before 1963 in Japan, for example, foreign ownership was limited to 49% and in ‘vital’ industries, foreign investment was banned altogether. Moreover, Taiwan had a strategy of using their state-owned enterprises to provide the private sector with cheap, high-quality inputs, giving the private sector an advantage in global trade. The execution of appropriate policies such as this transformed their economies into the successful economies we see today. And though good fortune may have played a part, it would be inaccurate to claim that these countries grew by chance and not by good policymaking.</p>

            <p>The 2008 financial crisis had a large impact on many countries economies. Some countries, however, suffered less than others. China’s growth did not fall below 6% and Australia’s worst quarter was 0%, whilst Japan, Mexico, and the UK suffered annual contractions of 5% to 10%. The countries that performed better did have good policies such as lower loan-to-deposit ratios and higher foreign exchange reserves. Indonesia, for example, had a growth rate of 4.6% in 2009, compared to the European Union who suffered a -4.3% growth rate. The government of Indonesia and the Bank of Indonesia took measures to mitigate the effect of the crisis. For example, they increase confidence in the banking sector by raising the ceiling on the deposit guarantee from 100 million to 2 billion rupees per account. Besides that, they lowered the interest rate from 9.5% in November 2008 to 6.5% by the end of 2009, which reduced the probability of companies defaulting. These measures facilitated economic stability in Indonesia, suggesting that good policies are crucial for economic growth.</p>
